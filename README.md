Vegas SMS Bubbles Theme
====================

This is the initial theme template for Vegas SMS. This template will theme the secret messaging app's text messager. You can set any incoming and outgoing message background separately, as well as the send message button graphic. You can also specify a custom default full resolution wallpaper and the default incoming and outgoing message font color.

The template is quite lite because most aspects of the messager are themeable from within the app itself. You can set any background you want from the menu, incoming/outgoing font color, and many more settings.

To modify this theme all you have to do is:

1: Change the package name in the manifest to anything else.

2: Change the meta-data value with name "vegas_messager_theme". Keep the name unchanged, and change the value to whatever you'd like to name the theme.

3: Change the drawable resources in the xhdpi folder to anything you'd like. The selector resources in the drawables folder need to remain named the same.

4: You can specify a custom default wallpaper by including a graphic named vegas_messager_wallpaper in any density bucket. It's recommended to use reasonable resolution, ie. xxhdpi is 1080 and xhdpi is 720.
